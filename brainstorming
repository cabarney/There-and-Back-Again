There and Back Again


I'm a PC

MS hasn't cared about the front-end 
	ASP
	ASP.NET
	ASP.NET MVC
	No Guidance!  (a good thing!)
	TypeScript
	OWIN / Katana

So what should we do on the client?

So many JS Libraries

Categorize?

Demos
	Underscore
	AngularJS
	Durandal 
	Breeze
	TypeScript

	Bootstrap?
	Katana?

	Hot Towel

	Bring it all together?
