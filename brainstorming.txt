There and Back Again


I'm a PC

MS hasn't cared about the front-end 
	ASP
	ASP.NET
	ASP.NET MVC even

The things started to change...
	No Guidance!  (a good thing!)
	TypeScript
	OWIN / Katana

	Web Essentials
	VS 2013 Improvements

So what should we do on the client?

So many JS Libraries

Categorize?

Demos

	Underscore
	AngularJS
	Durandal 
	Breeze
	TypeScript

	Bootstrap?
	Katana?

	Side Waffle?
	Hot Towel

	Bring it all together?


Start with WebAPI - GET in JS
Basic binding with Knockout
Do some LINQ-style manipulation with Underscore
Introduce Breeze
Compose with Durandal
Show some TypeScript

Angular???


Maybe instead just show some canned demos from the library's sites?

Underscore - jsFiddle
Knockout - show tuts, jsFiddle
Breeze - nice ToDo demo available via NuGet
Durandal - StarterKit? (NuGet)
Toastr
Knockout Validation plugin
Typescript??? 

AplifyJS?

HotTowel, SideWaffle
